# Authentication System Testing Checklist

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Unit 4 Authentication System including all security enhancements.

## 1. Login Flow Testing

### Valid Login Scenarios
- [ ] Login with valid email and password
- [ ] Verify successful redirect to intended page
- [ ] Confirm user state is properly set in auth store
- [ ] Check that admin status is correctly determined
- [ ] Verify session timeout is established

### Invalid Login Scenarios
- [ ] Login with invalid email format
- [ ] Login with non-existent email
- [ ] Login with incorrect password
- [ ] Verify generic error messages (no information leakage)
- [ ] Check rate limiting after multiple failed attempts

### Rate Limiting Tests
- [ ] Attempt 5 failed logins to trigger lockout
- [ ] Verify account lockout message appears
- [ ] Confirm login button becomes disabled during lockout
- [ ] Test automatic lockout reset after 15 minutes
- [ ] Verify warning messages for remaining attempts

## 2. Registration Flow Testing

### Valid Registration Scenarios
- [ ] Register with all required fields filled correctly
- [ ] Verify password strength meter shows "Strong" status
- [ ] Confirm automatic login after registration
- [ ] Check redirect to /account page
- [ ] Verify profile is created in database

### Password Strength Testing
- [ ] Test password with < 8 characters (should fail)
- [ ] Test password without uppercase letter
- [ ] Test password without lowercase letter  
- [ ] Test password without numbers
- [ ] Test password without special characters
- [ ] Verify visual feedback for each requirement
- [ ] Confirm registration button disabled for weak passwords

### Registration Validation
- [ ] Test with invalid email formats
- [ ] Test with mismatched password confirmation
- [ ] Test with empty full name field
- [ ] Verify form validation error messages
- [ ] Test special characters in name field

## 3. Route Guard Testing

### Guest Route Protection
- [ ] Access /login while authenticated (should redirect to home)
- [ ] Access /register while authenticated (should redirect to home)
- [ ] Verify proper redirect behavior

### Authentication Required Routes
- [ ] Access /account without login (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Access /checkout without login (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Verify redirect query parameter is preserved
- [ ] Test successful access after authentication

### Admin Route Protection
- [ ] Access /admin as regular user (should redirect to account)
- [ ] Access /admin as admin user (should allow access)
- [ ] Verify admin status checking works correctly
- [ ] Test admin routes with expired sessions

## 4. Session Management Testing

### Session Persistence
- [ ] Login and refresh browser (session should persist)
- [ ] Close and reopen browser (session should persist)
- [ ] Test session restoration on app startup
- [ ] Verify checkAuthStatus function works correctly

### Session Timeout
- [ ] Wait for 2-hour timeout (or modify timeout for testing)
- [ ] Verify automatic logout occurs
- [ ] Confirm warning message is displayed
- [ ] Test session extension functionality
- [ ] Verify all state is cleared on timeout

### Logout Functionality
- [ ] Test manual logout button
- [ ] Verify all state is cleared (user, profile, auth status)
- [ ] Confirm security counters are reset
- [ ] Check that session timeout is cancelled
- [ ] Test redirect behavior after logout

## 5. Security Feature Testing

### Information Security
- [ ] Verify error messages don't reveal if email exists
- [ ] Test that password requirements are enforced
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive data in browser storage
- [ ] Check for XSS vulnerabilities in input fields

### State Management Security
- [ ] Test auth store state persistence
- [ ] Verify security counters work correctly
- [ ] Test lockout state management
- [ ] Confirm proper state cleanup on logout

## 6. Error Handling Testing

### Network Errors
- [ ] Test login with network offline
- [ ] Test registration with server errors
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling
- [ ] Check user feedback for network issues

### API Error Responses
- [ ] Test with invalid Supabase configuration
- [ ] Test with expired API tokens
- [ ] Verify proper error message display
- [ ] Test retry mechanisms

## 7. User Experience Testing

### Form Interactions
- [ ] Test tab navigation through forms
- [ ] Verify proper focus management
- [ ] Test form submission with Enter key
- [ ] Check loading states and disabled buttons

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Verify password strength meter updates in real-time
- [ ] Check color coding for security warnings
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Confirm accessibility features work

### Toast Notifications
- [ ] Verify success messages appear for login/register
- [ ] Check error messages for failed attempts
- [ ] Test warning messages for security issues
- [ ] Confirm proper message timing and styling

## 8. Cross-Browser Testing

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test in Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Test in Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Test in Safari (if available)
- [ ] Test in Edge (latest)
- [ ] Verify consistent behavior across browsers

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Verify touch interactions work correctly
- [ ] Check responsive form layouts

## 9. Performance Testing

### Load Times
- [ ] Measure login form render time
- [ ] Test auth state restoration speed
- [ ] Verify password strength meter performance
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in auth store

### Concurrent Sessions
- [ ] Test multiple browser tabs with same user
- [ ] Verify logout affects all tabs
- [ ] Test session conflicts
- [ ] Check state synchronization

## 10. Integration Testing

### Database Integration
- [ ] Verify profile creation on registration
- [ ] Test admin flag retrieval
- [ ] Check user data persistence
- [ ] Test database transaction handling

### API Integration
- [ ] Test all auth API endpoints
- [ ] Verify proper error handling from Supabase
- [ ] Check request/response formatting
- [ ] Test API rate limiting (if implemented)

## Testing Tools and Setup

### Manual Testing
1. Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Use browser storage inspector for state verification
4. Test with different screen sizes

### Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)
- Consider adding Cypress or Playwright tests
- Unit tests for auth store functions
- Component tests for form validation
- E2E tests for complete auth flows
