## 🤖 What is Agent MCP?

Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol (MCP) enables multiple AI agents to work together on complex software projects by:

- **Shared Context**: Agents maintain shared project knowledge
- **Task Coordination**: Distributed task management and assignment  
- **File Safety**: Preventing conflicts when multiple agents edit code
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time collaboration monitoring
- **Specialized Roles**: Different agents handle different aspects (UI, backend, testing, etc.)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

These examples demonstrate:

1. **Agent Coordination Patterns** - How agents communicate and collaborate
2. **Real-world Complexity** - Managing full applications with multiple components
3. **Quality Assurance** - Automated testing and validation workflows
4. **Conflict Resolution** - How agents avoid stepping on each other's work
5. **Knowledge Sharing** - Persistent context and learning between agents

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project includes:
- Complete source code
- MCP database (`.agent` directory) 
- Setup instructions
- Documentation of agent workflows

Pick a project and explore how AI agents can collaborate to build complex software!
